Code Cleanup:

- Everywhere there's a print statement, that was because we weren't doing something with a response
    or an exception. W
- More specific exception/error handling
- Better logging:
    - DEBUG through ERROR logging levels
        - log all exceptions
    - MixPanel,
    - Slack
- Create, add, update, delete for all tables
- Test create, add, update, delete all tables
- Separate tests into different files according to module
- Re-add 'mod_addresses' and 'mod_organizations' when ready
- Completely revamp the 'mod_reminders' module
- Add cascades to all database relationships
- delete_patient is broken when the patient is added to an org. Only revealed when connected to azure sql db.
- Have the testing config go to a testing azure sql db since mssql is different that sqlite.
